## Improvements to make

Use data standard

At the moment HTM is not integrated using one of the supported protocols.

HTM should offer the data using one of the standards: GBFS, MDS or TOMP.

### Add vehicle type

🆕 The operator should communicate what kind of vehicle it's reporting. 

Since GBFS 2.1 there's a field, `vehicle_type_id`, that defines what kind of vehicle is offered.

To implement this, you can use these documentation pages: 

1. Offer [vehicle_types.json](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md#vehicle_typesjson-added-in-v21)
2. In free_bike_status.json, add property [vehicle_type_id](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md#free_bike_statusjson)

As values you can use the [latest](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/pull/370) standard definition for mopeds:

- name: `HTM fiets type 1`,
- vehicle_type_id: `htm_type_1`
- form_factor: `moped`
- propulsion_type: `electric`
- wheel_count: `2`
