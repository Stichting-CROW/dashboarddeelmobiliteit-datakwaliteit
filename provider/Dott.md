| 2022-03-30 | We are in direct contact with the Engineering Manager at Dott, on how to integrate with CROW Dashboard. We communicate using a private Slack channel at Dott's Slack. We share: "For succesful integration with CROW Dashboard there should be a GBFS feed that has vehicles that keep their vehicle IDs static as long as they're in public space, or the MDS `/vehicles` end point should be offered."
| 2022-03-29 | We speak with Dott's General Manager The Netherlands by phone. Goal: finalize the integration for Amersfoort soon.
| 2022-03-29 | Dott sends extra info on the data standards they support: "For GBFS we support v2.2 and v3.0. MDS has full v0.4 implementation. MDS has a partial implementation for the Provider component at v1.2. Please note this is only partial support of full v1.2 Provider component (we only make available the Trips and Status Changes endpoints)"
| 2022-03-22 | Dott emails and aks: "Currently our implementation of MDS requires that we share credentials on a per-region basis (due to some technical constraints). For the coming launch in The Netherlands, we have several cities in scope (Apeldoorn, Zwolle, Amesfoort, Hengelo, Enschede). For each of these cities (and others to come) we would have to provide you with credentials for each city. Is this a problem for you and your organization? Do know that we will be working on building a more robust system in the
future."
| 2022-02-22 | We did an introduction call. Dott will share a MDS feed soon. Dott starts to be active in The Netherlands +- March 2022
