## Logs

| Updated    | Description
| ----       | ---
| 2022-01-24 | TIER emails and asks: 'Is it possible to process multiple seperate feeds instead of 1 feed for all places in NL?'
| 2022-01-21 | TIER mentions that there's not 1 NL feed, but only individual feeds per city. "Providing one API link for all cities is more work and needs to be included later on the road map"
| 2022-01-10 | TIER pro-actively asks if Eindhoven and Amersfoort can be added as well. We reply: If these cities are added to to the existing GBFS (NL) feed, these are included automatically
| 2021-12-23 | GBFS feed for TIER Utrecht is added!
| 2021-10-13 | From a legal side we are fine and can start working on the technical implementation together with CROW
