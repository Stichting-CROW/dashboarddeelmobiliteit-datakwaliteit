| Updated    | Description
| ----       | ---
| 2022-01-10 | TIER pro-actively asks if Eindhoven and Amersfoort can be added as well. We informed that if these cities are added to to the existing GBFS (NL) feed, these are included automatically.
| 2021-12-23 | GBFS feed for TIER Utrecht is added!
| 2021-10-13 | From a legal side we are fine and can start working on the technical implementation together with CROW
