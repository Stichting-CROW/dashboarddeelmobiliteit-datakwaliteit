| 2021-12-02 | Email from Bondi: 'We will send the TOMP feed URL as soon as it's available, presumably in January 2022.'
| 2021-10-27 | Email from Bondi: "We are switching app providers for the 1st of Jan. The new provider (Wunder mobility) has TOMP support". We linked the [HR data spec](https://docs.crow.nl/deelfietsdashboard/hr-dataspec/) to make sure the TOMP feed will have static IDs, like in our specification.
