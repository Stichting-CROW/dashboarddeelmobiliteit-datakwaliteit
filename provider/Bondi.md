## Logs

| Updated    | Description
| ----       | ---
| 2022-03-25 | We email Bondi: 'Can we help with getting Bondi into the CROW Dashboard? We could help testing a data feed offered by wunder mobility?'
| 2022-03-23 | Gemeente Den Haag asks: "Bondi switches to [wunder mobility](https://www.wundermobility.com/) in June. Can wunder mobility offer a feed so Bondi can integrate with CROW Dashboard?"
| 2022-02-02 | Bondi emails: "I received some info from our software provider. The current version of MDS doesn't support the /vehicles endpoints. They expect to upgrade the MDS feed in Q2. I will keep you updated when there are any changes". We reply that MDS is prefered, but GBFS and TOMP works as well. We'll wait on Bondi's update in Q2
| 2022-01-15 | We asked for documentation on how to use the authentication key
| 2022-01-14 | Bondi sent an MDS URL and authentication key
| 2022-01-10 | Email from Bondi: 'We do not yet switch to the new app provider in the next 4 months. Until we switch we don't have a TOMP feed yet.'
| 2021-12-02 | Email from Bondi: 'We will send the TOMP feed URL as soon as it's available, presumably in January 2022.'
| 2021-10-27 | Email from Bondi: 'We are switching app providers for the 1st of Jan. The new provider (Wunder mobility) has TOMP support.' We linked the [HR data spec](https://docs.crow.nl/deelfietsdashboard/hr-dataspec/) to make sure the TOMP feed will have static IDs, like in our specification.
