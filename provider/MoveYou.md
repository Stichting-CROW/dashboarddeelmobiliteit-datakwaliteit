| ----       | ---
| 2022-02-17 | We ask MoveYou: can you offer a GBFS feed as in our [specs](https://docs.crow.nl/deelfietsdashboard/hr-dataspec/)?
| 2022-02-17 | Province of Zeeland asks to include GoAbout for Vlissingen en Middelburg, because this is a requirement for participation in the Dutch national pilot "deelfietsen op treinstations". Deelfietsen Zeeland uses GoAbout bikes that are offered by MoveYou. NS Station Vlissingen is part of the pilot.
| 2022-02-03 | MoveYou/GoAbout emails: MoveYou has acquired GoAbout and will keep operating using the GoAbout brand. MoveYou already has a GBFS and TOMP feed, though having dynamic ID's. MoveYou will check if static IDs can be offered. Otherwise it will be added to the backlog
| 2022-02-02 | We asked MoveYou/GoAbout to offer a data feed
| 2022-01-24 | Created MoveYou/GoAbout status page
