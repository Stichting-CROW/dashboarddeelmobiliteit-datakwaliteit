# 2022 CROW Dashboard data quality year overview

## BAQME

- From 2022-02-11 +- 13:20 until 2022-02-15 12:40 there were no vehicle updates, because of an error in the BAQME feed. Result is that:

  1. in the 'parked' data vehicles seem to be standing still in public space for a long time (although they have been used for sure)
  2. in the 'rentals' data no rentals were done in those 4 days

## Bird

- From ?? until ??? Bird data cannot be trusted. The data feed didn't share vehicles most of the time, which gives unreliable results
- From 2022-02-21 Bird data is available in the CROW Dashboard

## GO Sharing

- From 2022-01-01 until ?? the rentals were missing in the GO Sharing data. Because of this all information related to rentals is unreliable. In example you can't trust "amount of rentals per day", "amount of rentals per vehicle per day" and "average rental time"

## Felyx

- Until 2022-03-29 Enschede was missing in the Felyx data
- From 2022-01-01 until 2022-01-27 18:28 Haarlem and Den Bosch were missing in the Felyx data

## LIME

- From 2022-01-01 until ?? no data was available, because the LIME GBFS feed didn't meet the specifications
