# 2022 CROW Dashboard data quality year overview

## BAQME

- From 2022-02-11 +- 13:20 until 2022-02-15 12:40 there were no vehicle updates, because of an error in the BAQME feed. Result is that:

  1. in the 'parked' data vehicles seem to be standing still in public space for a long time (although they have been used for sure)
  2. in the 'rentals' data no rentals were done in those 4 days

## Bird

- From ?? until ??? Bird data cannot be trusted. The data feed didn't share vehicles most of the time, which gives unreliable results
- From 2022-02-21 Bird data is available in the CROW Dashboard

## Dott

- From 2022-05-18 until 2022-06-08 Amersfoort data was missing.

## GO Sharing

- From 2022-01-01 until ?? the rentals were missing in the GO Sharing data. Because of this all information related to rentals is unreliable. In example you can't trust "amount of rentals per day", "amount of rentals per vehicle per day" and "average rental time"

## Felyx

- Until 2022-03-29 Enschede was missing in the Felyx data
- From 2022-01-01 until 2022-01-27 18:28 Haarlem and Den Bosch were missing in the Felyx data

## LIME

- From 2022-01-01 until ?? no data was available, because the LIME GBFS feed didn't meet the specifications


## Missing data

- From 2022-04-11 **13:35 until 13:55** the Redis server of Dashboard Deelmobiliteit has been disabled because of a bug. Result is that for these 20 minutes the Dashboard Deelmobiliteit hasn't been recording any mobility data from the connected providers.<br /><br />Park events with end time `2022-04-11T15:00:00` are not completely reliable. For these park events it could be that there have been multiple park events in those 20 minutes, instead of only 1. It could also be that these park events did start but not end (but we set an end time manually).<br /><br />Because of the Redis outage on 2022-04-11 we did the following database fix:

```
UPDATE
park_events
SET end_time = '2022-04-11T15:00:00'
WHERE end_time is null
AND bike_id IN (
    SELECT bike_id                                                                           
    FROM (SELECT bike_id, COUNT(*), max(park_event_id) as exclude_park_event_id
        FROM park_events 
        WHERE end_time is null group by bike_id) AS q1 WHERE count > 1
)
AND park_event_id NOT IN(
SELECT exclude_park_event_id                                                                           
    FROM (SELECT bike_id, COUNT(*), max(park_event_id) as exclude_park_event_id
        FROM park_events 
        WHERE end_time is null group by bike_id) AS q1 WHERE count > 1
);
```
